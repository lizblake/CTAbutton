__Team Notes__


_Tues 28th:_<br /> 
Liz was working on trying to figure out how to add a dropdown menu finction to our button and got it to add the dropdown but she needed to figure out how to get it they way we wanted it. We talked to the Gray Goose button team, they asked us about our hover state, and we showed them how we did it through our code since they had thiers as transparent and wanted to do it differently. We both needed at add the disabled function to our butttons, and I had tried to get the disabled function to work over the weekend based on the youtude video Bryan posted, but mine kept coming up with errors and couldn't get it to work. We also both had the basic button layouts that we wanted, but they needed to work more on the colors they wanted their button to ultimatly be.

_Thurs 23rd:_<br /> 
We learned how to add an icon to our buttons, we picked the dino icon to be the icon for our button but it was not working even though the other ones were, so we ended up going with the bookmark.

_Tues 21st:_<br /> 
Today we learned how to add the properties of the button as well as that using tags would be a huge benefit to us. Our next steps are going to be to communicate with each other to see where we are at and then where we plan to go from there. We also plan to fix the suggestions that were given by the professor, as well as continue to add the features that we still needed for our button like be able to disable the button as well as other states for the button

_Thurs 16th:_<br /> 
We worked in class as well as messaged after class to figure out want we wanted to do for our button and got the boilerplate all set up.
