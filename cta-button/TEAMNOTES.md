__Team Notes__


_Thur 30th:_<br />
We listened to Bryan showing how he edited Group 1 button, since they did extra work. We also set up our NPM accounts, and Adam made the organization for us to publish our projects too. 

_Tues 28th:_<br /> 
We talked to the Gray Goose button team, they asked us about our hover state, and we showed them how we did it through our code since they had thiers as transparent and wanted to do it differently. We both needed at add the disabled function to our butttons, and I had tried to get the disabled function to work over the weekend based on the YouTube video Bryan posted, but mine kept coming up with errors and couldn't get it to work. We also both had the basic button layouts that we wanted, but they needed to work more on the colors they wanted their button to ultimately be.

_Thur 23rd:_<br /> 
We learned how to add an icon to our buttons, we picked the dino icon to be the icon for our button but it was not working even though the other ones were, so we ended up going with the bookmark.

_Tues 21st:_<br /> 
Today we learned how to add the properties of the button as well as that using tags would be a huge benefit to us. Our next steps are going to be to communicate with each other to see where we are at and then where we plan to go from there. We also plan to fix the suggestions that were given by the professor, as well as continue to add the features that we still needed for our button like be able to disable the button as well as other states for the button

_Thur 16th:_<br /> 
We worked in class as well as messaged after class to figure out want we wanted to do for our button and got the boilerplate all set up.
